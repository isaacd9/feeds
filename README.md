## My Feeds
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/isaacd9/feeds.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/isaacd9/feeds)

This is my personal list of RSS feeds I subscribe to. I have a cron job that
runs on that pulls this periodically and generates a feed using a minorly
forked version of [picofeed](https://github.com/seenaburns/picofeed).

I serve it publicly, so feel free to read along with me:
[feed.isaac.diamonds](https://feed.isaac.diamonds).

I'm always looking for more interesting blogs and articles to subscribe to
(particularly those written by women, people of color, and folks that are
otherwise under-represented in tech). If you think I should be reading
something and don't see it here, please send me a pull request!
